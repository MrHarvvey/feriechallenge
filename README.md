üéÑÔ∏è# 10 day coding challenge with Python
This repository contains 10 day winter-break coding challenge. Each day there was a problem to solve. The idea of the challenge is to learn something new and adapt the problem to own programming skills.

What I learned during the challenge?

‚Ä¢ Discovered a wide range of Python modules,

‚Ä¢ Got familliar with many different APIs, processing requests and using the data in the code,

‚Ä¢ Improved my knowledge of modules previously known to me,

‚Ä¢ Coding regularily, the challenge gave me a routine to follow and problems to solve, which I often extended to make more challenging. 

‚Ä¢ Became more fluent with reading documentation.
